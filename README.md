# Fresh Theme for Jekyll

The Jekyll-Fresh theme is a port of the gorgeous [Fresh](https://github.com/cssninjaStudio/fresh) landing page starter built by [CSS Ninja](https://cssninja.io/). A [live demo](https://mrnoutahi.com/Jekyll-Fresh/) is available.

## Theme configuration

The theme is quite customizable. The full list of configurable variable is available in the  [`_config.yml`](_config.yml) file. Adjust the values in `config.yaml` and the images in `static/img` to personalize your landing page. Feel free to change the `css` to fit your needs.

## Using this theme with GitHub Pages

Please follow the github-page tutorial here: https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/ 

If there are problems with loading assets like CSS files and images, make sure that the baseurl in the `_config.yml` is set correctly.

Please check out the [Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/), if you want to host your website somewhere else than GitHub, or would like build and run it locally.
