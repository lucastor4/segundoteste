# Fresh Theme for Jekyll

The Jekyll-Fresh theme is a port of the gorgeous [Fresh](https://github.com/cssninjaStudio/fresh) landing page starter built by [CSS Ninja](https://cssninja.io/).

## Theme configuration

The theme is quite customizable. The full list of configurable variable is available in the  [`_config.yml`](_config.yml) file. Adjust the values in `config.yaml` and the images in `static/img` to personalize your landing page. Feel free to change the `css` to fit your needs.
